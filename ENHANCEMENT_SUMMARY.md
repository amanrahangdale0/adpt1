## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Authentication:** Currently uses localStorage (not production-ready)
   - For production, replace with JWT tokens + backend auth
   
2. **API Key:** Stored in backend .env file
   - Consider secure key management for production
   
3. **AI Features:** Require backend server running
   - Works offline except for AI-powered features

---

## 🔮 Future Recommendations

1. **Authentication:**
   - Implement JWT-based authentication
   - Add password hashing (bcrypt)
   - Consider OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)

2. **Database:**
   - Migrate from localStorage to IndexedDB for larger data
   - Add optional cloud sync (Firebase/Supabase)

3. **AI Features:**
   - Add support for multiple AI providers (Claude, Gemini)
   - Implement caching for AI responses
   - Add rate limiting

4. **PWA Features:**
   - Add service worker for true offline support
   - Enable "Add to Home Screen"
   - Implement background sync

5. **Analytics:**
   - Track user progress over time
   - Show weekly/monthly study reports
   - Add achievement badges

---

## 💡 Tips for Maintenance

1. **Keep dependencies updated:**
   ```bash
   npm outdated
   npm update
   ```

2. **Test on multiple devices:**
   - Desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
   - Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Android)
   - Different screen sizes

3. **Monitor localStorage usage:**
   - Current limit: ~5-10MB per domain
   - Consider migration to IndexedDB if needed

4. **Backup environment files:**
   - Keep `.env.example` updated
   - Document any new environment variables

---

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify backend server is running (port 5000)
3. Clear localStorage and try fresh install
4. Check that API key is properly configured in `.env`

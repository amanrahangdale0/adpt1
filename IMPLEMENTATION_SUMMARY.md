## 🎯 Key Features

### Schedule Generation Algorithm
```
Priority = Difficulty Weight + Exam Urgency

Difficulty Weight:
  Hard: +3 points
  Medium: +2 points
  Easy: +1 point

Exam Urgency:
  ≤7 days: +5 points (Critical!)
  ≤14 days: +3 points (Important)
  ≤30 days: +2 points (Soon)
  >30 days: +1 point (Later)

Session Duration:
  Hard: 1.5-2 hours
  Medium: 1-1.5 hours
  Easy: 0.5-1 hour
  
Breaks: +15 minutes between sessions (if enabled)
```

### Progress Tracking System
```
XP Earning:
  - 2 XP per minute studied
  - 50 XP bonus per completed session

Streak Logic:
  - +1 streak for consecutive days
  - Reset if >1 day gap
  - Today's minutes reset daily

## 💡 Tips for Users

1. **Set Exam Dates** - Schedule prioritizes urgent exams!
2. **Choose Difficulty** - Harder subjects get more time
3. **Configure Preferences** - Match your study style
4. **Study Daily** - Build streaks for motivation
5. **Complete Sessions** - Earn bonus XP!

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Schedule Not Appearing
- Check: Did you add subjects?
- Check: Did you generate the schedule?
- Check: Look in Schedule page (not popup)

### Dashboard Shows 0 Stats
- Normal for first-time users!
- Stats update after studying
- Add study time manually if needed

### Redirect Loop
- Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
- Restart onboarding
- Should work after that
